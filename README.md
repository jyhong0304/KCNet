This repository is the official implementation of [KCNet : An Insect-Inspired Single-Hidden-Layer Neural Network with Randomized Binary Weights for Prediction and Classification Tasks]. 

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running 

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :
